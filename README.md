# T80 Starter
## Pre-made boilerplate, so you can actually spend more time on your game!

### What is it?

T80 Starter is essentially a skeleton to get you started writing a game using TIC-80. Once you throw the code into your editor you'll have an array of tools at your disposal to get you started.
You know all that boring state machine stuff? Yeah, we got you covered. Sprite drawing, entities and animations? Yep, in there too.

### What exactly does come with T80 Starter?

* A class system with inheritance. Makes working with entities so much easier.
* Scene manager. This controls all of your scenes (ie: Title screen, main game, end screen, etc).
* Base scene class
* Entity Manager
* Base entity class
* An example player entity. Nothing fancy, but shows how the animations work.
* Two example scenes. This is to demonstrate scene switching using the scene manager

### What doesn't it do?

Quite a lot really. Most notably, Physics. Yes the example player entity can move left and right, but that is just to demonstrate animations.
I really only wanted to add the basics to this project. This gives you the mundane, necessity barebones, but the flexibility to add lots of other stuff on top yourself.
I may look at adding a new version with configurable physics, while keeping this one in tact.
