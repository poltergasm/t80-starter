# T80 Starter
## Pre-made boilerplate, so you can actually spend more time on your game!

### What is it?

T80 Starter is essentially a skeleton to get you started writing a game using TIC-80. Once you throw the code into your editor you'll have an array of tools at your disposal to get you started.
You know all that boring state machine stuff? Yeah, we got you covered. Sprite drawing, entities and animations? Yep, in there too.

### What exactly does come with T80 Starter?

* A class system with inheritance. Makes working with entities so much easier.
* Scene manager. This controls all of your scenes (ie: Title screen, main game, end screen, etc).
* Base scene class
* Entity Manager
* Base entity class
* An example player entity. Nothing fancy, but shows how the animations work.
* Two example scenes. This is to demonstrate scene switching using the scene manager
